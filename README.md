Once the student data is corrected and merged with the school data, and the summary dataframes are recreated, answer the following questions:
- How is the district summary affected?
- How is the school summary affected?
- How is the Thomas High School's performance relative to other schools affected?
- How are math and reading scores by grade affected?
- How are scores by school spending affected?
- How are sores by school size affected?
- How are scores by school type affected?
