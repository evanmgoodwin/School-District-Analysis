# School-District-Analysis

## Challenge Overview
After Maria discovered the math and reading score errors of all 9th graders at Thomas High School, you are tasked with replacing those specifc data points with a NaN value, and recreating all of the summaries. Once the student data is corrected and merged with the school data, and the summary dataframes are recreated, answer the following questions:
- How is the district summary affected?
- How is the school summary affected?
- How is the Thomas High School's performance relative to other schools affected?
- How are math and reading scores by grade affected?
- How are scores by school spending affected?
- How are sores by school size affected?
- How are scores by school type affected?
